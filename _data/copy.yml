  about: "Welcome friends and neighbors - we're a new community organization dedicated to housing justice and keeping people in their homes in Kitsap! We're currently focused on stopping fixed income seniors from being evicted at Pinewood Park in East Bremerton, whose owners Hurst and Son have bought up 80+ mobile parks across WA, ID, MT, SD and are now jacking up rents and throwing seniors out of their homes. As individuals we are weak, but organized together we are strong - get involved to put our community over multi-millionaire landlords and outside investors!"
  welcome: "Welcome to Kitsap Housing For All!"
