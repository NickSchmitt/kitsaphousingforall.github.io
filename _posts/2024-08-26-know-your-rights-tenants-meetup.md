[Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/share/QzKSkbr7PcxCkN7j/)

Everyone knows we're facing a housing and homelessness crisis, but what can we do? Come learn about local housing issues and how to take action for housing justice! 

This event will help network and train mobile park residents and community members on how to create a tenants union and organize to protect housing rights. 

We will talk about our work at local Hurst and Sons mobile parks, help residents get organized, provide contact information for a local group that provides free mobile home repair services, and have a nice day in the park with snacks!

We also encourage park residents and concerned community members to network and share their experiences via the [Kitsap Housing for All Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1058190635711925)
