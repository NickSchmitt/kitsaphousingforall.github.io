Deb is president of the Leisure Manor Tenants Association and Caroline serves as secretary. The Association has been instrumental in alerting the Attorney General’s office to Hurst & Son violations of tenant protection laws, resulting in a heightened, in-depth, investigation into the company and their business practices. They have also been instrumental in adding a new city ordinance regarding Aberdeen manufactured home parks.

She is a tenant and a labor activist, a rank-and-file member of AFSCME 3758, and is also on the executive board for the Thurston Lewis Mason Central Labor Council. She believes that by uniting working people together into an independent political movement, we can win the battle for democracy and autonomy in our workplaces, in our homes, and in our communities.
 - **Zade Willow** is an organizer with Puget Sound Tenants Union, a member-run collective of tenants that organizes against rising rent, displacement, and eviction.
